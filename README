A distributed, scalable and fault-tolerant fortunes server developed
in Erlang as a pet project to experiment with Erlang and Yaws to
make scalable web applications.

Disclaimer: This is an old Erlang project from 2006 and there are
no plans yet to keep working on it, just uploading it to a git repo
to avoid losing the code forever :–)
